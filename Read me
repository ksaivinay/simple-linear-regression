# simple-linear-regression
This minute project which includes how to apply simple linear regression on the small dataset with 2 variables x and y. 
After exploring the data and eliminating null values, in order to fit the data to linear model, variables are resized. 
Using the sklearn package linear regressor was imported. After predicting the y variable a scatterplot was plotted and the model accuracy was determined.
